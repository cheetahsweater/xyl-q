# XyL-Q

Hello-Q! XyL-Q is a multiple utility Discord bot designed for general use in servers as well as more specific use for things me or my friends might need.

## Commands
(Note: *italicized* parameters are optional, regular parameters are mandatory)

As of right now, there are 13 commands, 12 of which can be used by all members of any server XyL-Q is in:
- ~~**/meme** *[top_text]* *[bottom_text]* *[image_link]* *[image_upload]* *[wiki]*  - This command generates a meme. If given top_text, bottom_text, or both, this will be the text on the bottom and bottom of the meme. If not, the text will be randomly chosen from a list of indexed messages in the server that the command is being used in. If given an image_link or image_upload, then that image will be the background of the meme. If not, then a random image will be chosen from one of the list of wikis available, unless a specific one is chosen by the user.

## Reputation
The reputation functionality of XyL-Q was inspired by the rep functionality in UB3R-B0T, a Discord bot that I respect very much but I disagreed with the way they implemented their rep function, so I made my own!

When a user sends a message that you appreciate and you want to give them a token of your appreciation, react with the medal emoji (üèÖ) and they will be given +1 reputation point! 

Now, you may be asking, what if I particularly despise a message somebody's sent, and I want to take away reputation from them? Well, you can do that too! Simply throw a tomato at them with the tomato emoji (üçÖ) and -1 reputation point will be taken away from them! Isn't democracy beautiful?!

## Roadmap
Here are some things I'm hoping to add soon!
- [ ]   A way for users to remove characters/sources from their lovelist
- [x]   A way for users to check their lovelist
- [ ]   Commands that allow configuration of reaction roles (Inspired by Carl-bot)
- [ ]   Commands that allow setup of a starboard feature with custom emojis
- [ ]   A command that searches Urban Dictionary for definitions
- [ ]   A more thorough version of fm-bot's affinity feature
- [ ]   A command to pet XyL-Q for his good work :)

Thank you for reading this! I'm glad I finally put it together!!! :3
